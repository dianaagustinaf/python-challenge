University of Birmingham / Data Analysis Assignment

In this assignment, I have completed two challenges in which I have applied my Python skills.

## PyBank

I've created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

CSV: [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv).


## PyPoll Instructions

In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

Set of poll: [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
I have created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
